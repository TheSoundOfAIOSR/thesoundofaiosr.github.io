Contributors will choose the specific topic to work on together at the onset of the project. Develop a code base with the new application / algorithm that other researchers can access openly. Write up research results in an academic paper. Submit paper at the 2021 Conference on AI Music Creativity.  Who can get involved?\r#\r\rEveryone in The Sound of AI community can contribute to OpenSource Research, regardless of your skillset.\nIn this research project, there will be many different tasks, such as coding, testing algorithms, evaluating models, writing up research, proofreading, managing the project, ….\nLike in an open source coding project, members with different skills can contribute to different tasks, depending on their expertise and their time availability.\nThere are only two requirements to participate in the project. You should have an interest in AI music. You should follow through with what you commit to work on.\nHow can I contribute?\r#\r\rDepending on your skillset you can contribute to one or more of these activities:\n Brainstorming ideas (topic) Brainstorming technical / methodological solutions Reading and summarising papers related to the topic of interest Writing code Testing code Writing documentation Evaluating models by running in-silico experiments Designing / running user studies to evaluate models Searching for datasets online / building a dataset Cleaning / preprocessing data Managing the project Writing up research \u0026hellip;  What do I get by participating?\r#\r\rFor members less experienced in research, OpenSource Research is a great opportunity to:\n Learn how to write research papers Learn how to carry out research from scratch and manage research projects Improve your research skills by learning from more experienced researchers Network with other researchers and practitioners  For more experienced members, this project is an opportunity to:\n Improve project management skills Give back to the community, by training less experienced researchers Network with other researchers Experiment a new way of doing research  For everyone, OpenSource Research is an opportunity to:\n Be part of a unique research experiment that may have a transformative impact on the wider academic community Work on a super cool research topic Be part of an amazing group of people Have an impact on the field of AI music  How can I get involved?\r#\r\rTo get involved with OpenSource Research, follow these steps:\n Fill up this survey. Sign up to The Sound of AI Slack workspace, if you aren’t already a member of the community. If you’re a member of The Sound of AI Slack, subscribe to the #open-source-research channel. Communication about the project will happen there. Once you have submitted the survey, Valerio will send you an email with further instructions and a link to sign-up to The Sound of AI Slack. Valerio will add you to all the services used to carry out research (Google Drive, Trello, etc) \u0026ndash; see \u0026ldquo;Project tools\u0026rdquo; section for more info.  Please note that Valerio will send out emails / add members to services in batches, once per week.\nProject tools\r#\r\rOpenSource Research is a complex project. It will use a number of different online tools to enable contributors to communicate, collaborate, and manage the work.\nCommunication\r#\r\rThe Sound of AI Slack\r#\r\rThe Sound of AI Slack workspace is the main venue where conversation among contributors happens. Here members can find announcements, talk to each other, and share resources.\nAll the conversations regarding the project will happen in the #open-source-research channel.\nDiscord\r#\r\rDiscord will be used to host video conference calls of small research groups in parallel.\nOpenSource Research mailing list\r#\r\rThe mailing list will be used to share general news, and let contributors know about upcoming meetups.\nGoogleMeet\r#\r\rGoogleMeet will be used to host conference calls for brainstorming and catch-up sessions.\nCollaboration\r#\r\rGoogle Drive\r#\r\rA dedicated folder on Google Drive will be used to store materials relevant for the research project (e.g., papers, data).\nGoogle Doc\r#\r\rGoogle Doc will be used to collaborate on the write-up of the paper. Members will be provided with “suggesting” privileges. Valerio (or lead researchers) will integrate text written by contributors.\nGitHub\r#\r\rA Github organization will be used to collaborate on the code developed for the project.\nProject management\r#\r\rTrello\r#\r\rTrello is an easy-to-use online project management tool that follows the Kanban system. Trello will help organise the work in modular tasks, keep track of the status of different tasks, and of who is working on what. Here is a tutorial that gets you started with Trello.\nProject roles\r#\r\rProject leader\r#\r\rValerio will coordinate the research project, and will choose the overall direction of the project based on the input coming from contributors.\nProject managers\r#\r\rThere are two project managers: Fernando Garcia and Wassim Filali. Their role is to coordinate activities and contributors. They also plan workflows, goals, and schedule for different project phases\nResearch coordinators\r#\r\rResearch coordinators are in charge of a Research Group (RG). A research group is a team of 5-8 contributors focused on one research deliverable. Research coordinators plan work and dedlines for a RG following the overall goals set by project leader and project managers. They act as scrum masters for a RG.\nResearch co-coordinators (CoCos)\r#\r\rCoCos provide logistical support to research coordinators.\nContributors\r#\r\rContributors will steer all the aspects of the research project (e.g., topic selection, solution design / implementation, evaluation, etc). They will be involved at all levels, from ideation to implementation.\nProject steps\r#\r\rThe project will be organised in a number of steps. Some of the steps may run in parallel and feed back into each other.\nIt is worth noting that these are general indications, which may be re-adjusted based on the needs and specificity of the chosen research topic.\n1. Preparation\r#\r\rIn this phase, contributors will get familiar with the AI Music Creativity space, project managers will be identified, and contributors can apply as research coordinators and co-coordinators.\n2. Topic selection\r#\r\rIn this phase, contributors will choose a topic that is in line with the scope of The 2021 Conference on AI Music Creativity.\n3. Literature review\r#\r\rDuring this step, contributors will gather, analyse, and discuss papers from the scientific literature that are related to the topic of interest. They will outline existing weaknesses and limitations in current solutions and suggest what is missing.\n4. Solution design\r#\r\rIn this step, contributors will have brainstorming sessions in order to come up with tentative solutions that address the chosen topic / problem.\n5. Solution implementation\r#\r\rIn this phase, contributors will develop the solution. This will likely be in the form of code.\n6. Evaluation\r#\r\rDuring this step, members will evaluate the validity of the proposed solution. Depending on the chosen topic, this will happen in different ways. For example, the proposed model(s) can be tested against other base-line solutions, or they can be evaluated using user studies.\n7. Write up\r#\r\rIn this phase, contributors will write up the research they carried out.\n8. Submission\r#\r\rThe paper will finally be submitted to The 2021 Conference on AI Music Creativity.\n9. Revisions\r#\r\rIn this phase, contributors will address the concerns of the reviewers and resubmit the improved paper.\nTimeline\r#\r\rEven though it is difficult to come up with a reliable timeline at this point, I will propose a tentative one:\n Preparation - 2 weeks Topic selection - 2 weeks Literature review - 4 weeks Solution design - 3 weeks Solution implementation - 6 weeks Evaluation - 4 weeks Write up - 4 weeks  License and authorship\r#\r\rAll the work produced (e.g., code, databases, algorithms) will be distributed using the MIT License.\nThe authors of the paper will be Valerio and The Sound of AI community.\nNetiquette\r#\r\r Be always respectful Be kind Be supportive Try to give more than take  Questions about research processes\r#\r\rThe project can indirectly provide insights into questions about research processes:\n Is there another viable way to carry out research that avoids the pitfalls of how research is traditionally carried out (e.g., focus on the number of papers published, rather than research quality)? Can open / crowdsourced research produce high-quality output? Can contributors with different expertise collaborate effectively towards a common research goal?  "});})();
